# Blog_W_Database_Final

Created a blog website using Node, Express and EJS template which allows user to insert new blogs and dynamically generates new pages foreach new blog. 
Furthermore, used Mongoose and MongoDB to store all the blogs and display on home screen.

Link to the website would be uploaded once deployed on the Heroku!
